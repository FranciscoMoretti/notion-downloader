# Video Support

Notion Downloader supports video playback through the `react-player` package. This allows you to easily embed and play videos from various sources, including YouTube, Vimeo, and more.

## Usage

Add the `standardVideoTransformer` plugin to your downloader config:

```json
{
   "conversion": {
        "plugins": [
            "standardVideoTransformer"
        ]
   }
}
```


To use video playback in your Notion-exported content, simply include the `ReactPlayer` component from `react-player`:

```jsx
import ReactPlayer from "react-player"

// In your component
<ReactPlayer url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
```

## Known Issues and Solutions

When using `react-player` with React 18 and Next.js, you may encounter hydration errors. This is due to differences between server-side rendering and client-side rendering of the video component.

To resolve these issues, we recommend using version 3.0.0-canary.4 or greater of `react-player`. This version includes improvements that help mitigate hydration problems in many cases.

### Installation

To install the recommended version:

```bash
npm install react-player@3.0.0-canary.4
```

## Additional Resources
