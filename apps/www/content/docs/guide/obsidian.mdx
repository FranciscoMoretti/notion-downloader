## Notion to Obsidian with notion-downloader

This guide explains how to set up a Obsidian vault that uses `notion-downloader` to pull content from Notion.
- Reference template repository: [https://github.com/FranciscoMoretti/notion-to-obsidian](https://github.com/FranciscoMoretti/notion-to-obsidian).

## Steps

1. Install `notion-downloader`:

```bash
npm install notion-downloader
```

2. Get your `NOTION_TOKEN` and `ROOT_ID` from the [Notion Setup](/docs/notion-setup/) guide.

3. Create the downloader configuration:

   Run `npx notion-downloader init` and use these options in `downloader.json` created:

```json
{
  ... 
  "conversion": {
    ... 
    "outputPaths": {
      "markdown": "./content/",
      "assets": "./content/assets/"
    },
    "markdownPrefixes": {
      "markdown": "",
      "assets": "assets/"
    },
    "layoutStrategy": {
      "markdown": "hierarchical",
      "assets": "flat"
    },
    "namingStrategy": "default",
    ... 
  }
  ... 
}
```

> Your Obsidian vault should point to the `content` folder. You can change `content` to any other folder name.


> This config puts all assets in the `assets` folder. See the [configuration reference](/docs/configuration) for more options.

4. Add your Notion token:

   a. In a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   NOTION_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

   b. Or use it directly with the CLI.

5. Run the downloader:

```bash
npx notion-downloader pull
```
