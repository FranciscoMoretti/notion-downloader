## Getting Your Notion API Token

To use the Notion API, you need to create an integration and get an API token. Here's how:

1. Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name your integration and select the workspace it'll be associated with.
4. Select "Internal integration" as the integration "type".
5. Click "Submit" to create the integration
6. You'll see your "Internal Integration Token" - this is your API token
7. Click "Save" to complete your integration

Keep this token secret and secure!

## Adding the Integration to Your Notion Page or Database

After creating the integration, you need to give it access to the specific pages or databases you want to work with:

1. Open the Notion page or database you want to access via the API
2. Click the "..." menu in the top right corner
3. Select "Connect to" from the dropdown
4. Find your integration in the list and click to add it

Now your integration can access this page/database and its children.

Remember: You need to add the integration to the root page/database of the tree you want to download.
