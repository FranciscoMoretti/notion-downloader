## Usage

Follow these steps to use the Notion Downloader:

1. **Initialize your project**
   Run the following command to create a `downloader.json` configuration file:

   ```bash
   npx notion-downloader init
   ```

   This will prompt you for the required configuration options and create a `downloader.json` file in your current directory.

2. **Configure downloader.json (Optional)**
   If needed, customize your `downloader.json` file by following the [Configuration Guide](/docs/config).

3. **Set up your Notion token**
   Refer to the [Notion Token Setup](/docs/notion-token) guide for instructions on obtaining your Notion token. Once you have your token, you can use it in one of two ways:

   a. Add it to a `.env` file in your project root:

   ```bash
   NOTION_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

   b. Use it directly with the CLI (see step 4).

4. **Download your Notion content**
   Run one of the following commands to pull your Notion content:

   a. If you've set up your token in a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   npx notion-downloader pull
   ```

   b. If you want to use the token directly with the CLI:

   ```bash
   npx notion-downloader pull --notion-token your_token_here
   ```

Choose the method that best fits your workflow. Using a `.env` file is recommended for security and convenience in development environments, while the CLI option is useful for quick tests or one-off operations.
